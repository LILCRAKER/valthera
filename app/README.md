## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- AWS Account with Cognito setup

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd blink/app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up AWS Cognito**
   - Deploy the CDK stack to create Cognito resources
   - Get the User Pool ID, User Pool Client ID, and Identity Pool ID from CDK outputs

4. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` and add your Cognito credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_your_user_pool_id
   VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=your_user_pool_client_id
   VITE_COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID=us-east-1:your_identity_pool_id
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Authentication Flow

### Public Routes
- **Landing Page** (`/`) - Welcome page with sign up/sign in options
- **Sign In** (`/signin`) - User authentication form
- **Sign Up** (`/signup`) - User registration form with email confirmation
- **Forgot Password** (`/forgot-password`) - Password reset form with code verification

### Protected Routes
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - User dashboard (requires authentication)

### Route Protection
- **PublicRoute**: Redirects authenticated users to dashboard
- **ProtectedRoute**: Redirects unauthenticated users to sign in

## AWS Cognito Setup

### 1. Deploy CDK Stack
1. Navigate to the `cdk` directory
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Deploy the stack: `cdk deploy`
4. Note the outputs for User Pool ID, User Pool Client ID, and Identity Pool ID

### 2. Configure Authentication
The CDK stack automatically configures:
- User Pool with email-based authentication
- User Pool Client with OAuth flows
- Identity Pool for AWS resource access
- Password policies and account recovery settings

### 3. Email Configuration
1. Go to AWS Cognito Console
2. Navigate to your User Pool
3. Go to Messaging > Email configuration
4. Configure your email provider (SES recommended)

## Billing Features

### Payment Method Management
- **Add Payment Methods** - Securely add credit/debit cards using Stripe Elements
- **Update Payment Methods** - Edit cardholder names and billing details
- **Remove Payment Methods** - Safely remove payment methods
- **Default Payment Method** - Set and manage default payment methods

### Subscription Management
- **View Current Plan** - See your current subscription status
- **Upgrade/Downgrade** - Change your subscription plan
- **Billing History** - View past invoices and payments

## API Key Management

The application manages API keys through Cognito custom attributes:

1. **Automatic User Profile Creation**: When a user signs up, a profile is automatically created
2. **API Key Generation**: Users can generate API keys from the dashboard
3. **API Key Storage**: API keys are stored as custom attributes in Cognito
4. **API Key Regeneration**: Users can regenerate their API keys

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cognito Configuration Issues
1. Check that your Cognito environment variables are correct
2. Verify that the User Pool Client is configured for your domain
3. Ensure email verification is enabled in your User Pool settings

### Authentication Issues
1. Check that your Cognito User Pool ID and Client ID are correct
2. Verify that email authentication is enabled in your Cognito settings
3. Make sure the callback URLs are configured properly

### API Key Issues

2. Check that the API key generation function is working
3. Verify that custom attributes are properly configured
