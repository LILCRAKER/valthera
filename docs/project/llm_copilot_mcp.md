# Modeling Copilot & MCP Server - Project Needs

## The Problem
Building ML models is **slow and fragmented**. Teams spend weeks on:
- Finding and preparing training data
- Figuring out which models to try
- Running experiments and comparing results
- Deploying and monitoring models

Most people either get stuck or need deep ML expertise.

## The Solution

### 1. Modeling Copilot
**What it does**: A conversational assistant that guides you through building ML models.

**For beginners**: Step-by-step help with data, training, and deployment
**For experts**: Fast iteration and automation

**Key features**:
- Discovers and prepares your training data
- Suggests models and configurations
- Runs training and shows progress
- Evaluates results and suggests improvements
- Deploys models to endpoints

### 2. MCP Server
**What it does**: Lets other AI agents integrate with your model building platform.

**Why it matters**: Other tools and agents can now:
- Create datasets and start training
- Monitor progress and get results
- Deploy models automatically

## Target Users
- **ML newcomers** who need guidance
- **Experienced practitioners** who want faster iteration
- **Tool builders** who want to integrate with the platform

## Success Metrics
- Time to first working model: < 15 minutes
- 80%+ completion rate for newcomers
- At least 3 external agents using the MCP server

## MVP Scope
- Basic classification/regression tasks
- Simple data upload and validation
- One baseline model per task
- Training launch and evaluation
- Manual endpoint creation
- Basic MCP tools for datasets, training, models

This solves the core problem: **making ML model development accessible and fast for everyone**.
